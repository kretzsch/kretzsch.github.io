                <p>
                    I am Thomas Kretzschmar, a sound designer, composer, and audio developer based in Amsterdam. I specialize in crafting chill soundtracks and immersive sound effects for games and interactive media. My music has reached a global audience, with millions of streams on Spotify and a consistent monthly listenership of 30,000–50,000.<br><br>
                    At Beyond Sports, I was responsible for introducing and building the entire audio experience from the ground up, implementing both Unity’s audio system and an FMOD audio package where previously there was no audio at all. Currently, I am developing a cozy game for Steam with a strong focus on music. My portfolio spans a wide range of genres, which you can explore further on my SoundCloud.                </p>

                                    <p>When thomas switched to our team I started working with him closely and saw the passion he had for his discipline and how it can enhance our projects. Thomas is creative and always comes with some good feedback. He's always willing to support and help people even if it's something to do with audio. Thomas understands the purpose of audio within our products and how to incorporate it within our pipeline, be it coding it himself to incorporate it or helping others to incorporate it.</p>
                                    <p>Personally Thomas is a great colleague that will quickly become a friend, always good company in the office and willing to help.</p>

                                    <p>I had the opportunity of mentoring Thomas during his internship as a Unity developer. During that time, he worked on a project showcasing how sound can drastically change the experience of our virtual game recreations. Everyone was extremely happy about his project, that's why we proposed him to continue his research in the company as Sound Designer. I really think Thomas can be a great asset for any company, thanks to his expertise in audio and his passion for development.</p>
